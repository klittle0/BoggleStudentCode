I began pseudocode. |

In my boggle class, I implemented my TST & started writing my DFS algorithm. |

| Jan 10 |  9:00-9:55am  | I finished my first draft of the solution. However, when testing, I always return 0 words instead of the correct number. After looking back through my code, I discovered that it's because my code is always breaking out of the base case when i ask if it's contained in the dictionary because the prefix always starts as "", which isn't in the dictionary. I realized that my issue was in the prefix find method in my TST class because I hadn't updated the recursive calls to be the correct method. That resolved some of my issues, allowing the prefixes to actually build. Now, the first few test cases work, but most of them don't. Next steps: figure out why the prefixes keep hitting the base cases prematurely. |

To fix this, I modified my TST lookup method so that, after any given word was added to good words, its "isWord" boolean was turned to false so that a duplicate couldn't be added as well. After making this change, all test cases work! |
